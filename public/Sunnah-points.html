    <p class="container benefits-text-p">In the course of the Battle of Khaybar, a poignant incident unfolded when our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was offered a roasted sheep by a Jewish woman. Consuming the meal, Prophet Muhammad and his companions soon sensed an alarming change. With discernment, the Prophet inquired about the nature of the dish, to which the woman admitted to having poisoned it. Immediately, the Prophet urged his companions to cease eating.</p> 
    <p class="container benefits-text-p">Addressing the woman's motive, she revealed her intention, explaining that if Muhammad were a false prophet, her action would rid the people of him, but if he were genuine, he would be unharmed. Undeterred, Prophet Muhammad, upon learning of the poisoning, sought remedy through the practice of cupping. Three points on the upper part of his back, known as the kahil, were specifically targeted. Displaying a profound act of compassion, he then directed his companions to undergo the same cupping treatment. Despite these efforts, some of his companions succumbed to the effects of the poisoning.</p> 
    <p class="container benefits-text-p">This incident not only underscores the unwavering trust and submission of the Prophet in the face of adversity but also highlights his adherence to natural remedies such as cupping for healing. The use of cupping in this context reflects its therapeutic significance in the Prophet's approach to health and well-being.</p> 
    <p class="container benefits-text-p">The episode during the Battle of Khaybar involving the attempted poisoning of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a poignant illustration of his remarkable resilience, discernment, and commitment to holistic healing practices. In this pivotal moment, a Jewish woman presented a seemingly innocuous gift—a roasted sheep—as an insidious attempt to harm the Prophet and his companions. Unbeknownst to them, the meal was laced with poison.</p> 
    <p class="container benefits-text-p">Upon partaking in the meal, Prophet Muhammad quickly perceived the alarming change and, with his characteristic discernment, inquired about the dish's nature. The woman, confronted with the Prophet's inquiry, admitted to her nefarious act. In response, the Prophet, displaying a profound sense of compassion and wisdom, immediately directed his companions to cease eating, preventing further harm.</p> 
    <p class="container benefits-text-p">The woman, upon being questioned about her motive, candidly revealed her intention. She explained that if Muhammad were a false prophet, her action would eliminate him, while if he were genuine, he would remain unharmed. Undeterred by this act of malice, Prophet Muhammad responded with resilience and a commitment to seeking remedy through natural means.</p> 
    <p class="container benefits-text-p">Choosing the practice of cupping, a form of therapeutic treatment, the Prophet underwent the procedure at three specific points on the upper part of his back known as the kahil. This method, characterized by creating a vacuum on the skin to stimulate blood flow, reflects the Prophet's reliance on natural remedies for healing. Remarkably, despite being the target of poisoning, the Prophet's concern extended to his companions. He directed them to undergo the same cupping treatment, exemplifying a leader's responsibility for the well-being of those under his care.</p> 
    <p class="container benefits-text-p">Tragically, despite these efforts, some of the companions succumbed to the effects of the poisoning, underscoring the severity of the situation. Nevertheless, this incident remains a profound testament to the Prophet's unwavering trust in divine protection, his resilience in the face of adversity, and his endorsement of natural remedies such as cupping in the pursuit of health and well-being. The narrative serves as a timeless example of the Prophet's adherence to principles of compassion, forgiveness, and reliance on holistic approaches to healing.</p>
